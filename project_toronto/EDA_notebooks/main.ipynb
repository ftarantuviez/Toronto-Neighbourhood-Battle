    "### Problem to solve\n",
    "    I am currently living in the West Side of Toronto, Canada in a neighbourhood called Dufferin, Dovercourt Village. I love where I live because all the amenities that the neighbourhood has (such as restaurants, gyms, coffee shops, etc). The problem start when I recive a spectacular job offer that I cannot reject, but the place of the job is far of Dufferin. So, I want to take a good decision, a data driven decision. Then, via Machine Learning techniques and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) I'll understand and compare the neighbourhoods in all Toronto having two principal parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "       1. Distance between the neighbourhood and the job place\n",
    "   \n",
    "       2. Similarity between my actual neighbourhood and the future one\n",

    "The dataset already passed the ETL process (Extract, Transform and Load). Currently is loaded in a database in IBM storage, but you can find it in this [url](https://github.com/ftarantuviez/data_science_capstone/blob/master/project_toronto/ETL_notebooks/datasets/toronto-venues.csv)\n",
